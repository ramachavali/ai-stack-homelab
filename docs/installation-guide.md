## 🧭 Before We Start

### What You Need
- Mac Mini M4 (2024) with macOS 14.0 or later
- At least 16GB RAM (32GB is better)
- At least 256GB free storage (500GB+ recommended)
- Stable internet connection for initial setup
- About 1-2 hours for complete setup

### What We'll Do
1. Install Docker (the software that runs everything)
2. Download the AI Stack files
3. Configure your secure passwords
4. Download AI models
5. Start your AI environment
6. Create your first AI chat!

---

## 🔧 Step 1: Install Docker Desktop

Docker is like a special container that keeps all your AI software organized and secure.

### Download Docker
1. Go to [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Click **"Download for Mac"**
3. Choose **"Mac with Apple Chip"** (for M4)
4. Wait for download (about 500MB)

### Install Docker
1. Open the downloaded file
2. Drag Docker to your Applications folder
3. Open Docker from Applications
4. When prompted, enter your Mac password
5. Follow the setup wizard (keep default settings)
6. Wait for Docker to start (you'll see a whale icon in your menu bar)

### Configure Docker for AI
1. Click the Docker whale icon in your menu bar
2. Select **"Settings"**
3. Go to **"Resources"**
4. Set these values:
   - **CPUs**: 8 (if you have 16GB RAM) or 6 (if you have less)
   - **Memory**: 12GB (if you have 16GB RAM) or 24GB (if you have 32GB+)
   - **Swap**: 2GB
   - **Disk**: 100GB
5. Click **"Apply & Restart"**

**✅ Test**: Open Terminal and type `docker --version`. You should see version information.

---

## 📁 Step 2: Set Up Your AI Stack

### Create Your Project Folder
1. Open **Terminal** (found in Applications > Utilities)
2. Copy and paste this command, then press Enter:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/ai-stack && cd ~/ai-stack
```
3. You should see your prompt change to show you're in the ai-stack folder

### Download AI Stack Files
You'll need to copy the AI Stack files to your new folder. The main files you need are:
- `docker-compose.yml` (the main configuration)
- `.env.example` (password template)
- `scripts/` folder (management tools)
- `configs/` folder (settings)

**Option 1: Download from GitHub** (if this is a GitHub project)
```bash
# Replace with actual repository URL
git clone [repository-url] .
```

**Option 2: Manual Copy**
Copy all the files provided in this conversation to your `~/ai-stack` folder.

---

## 🔐 Step 3: Set Up Your Security

### Create Your Environment File
In Terminal, in your ai-stack folder:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Generate Secure Passwords
You need several secure passwords. Run these commands one at a time and save the results:

```bash
# For database password
echo "POSTGRES_PASSWORD: $(openssl rand -base64 32)"

# For cache password  
echo "REDIS_PASSWORD: $(openssl rand -base64 32)"

# For workflow encryption (32 characters exactly)
echo "N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY: $(openssl rand -hex 16)"

# For web interface security (32 characters exactly)
echo "OPEN_WEBUI_SECRET_KEY: $(openssl rand -hex 16)"

# For backup encryption
echo "BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY: $(openssl rand -hex 16)"

# For API keys
echo "N8N_API_KEY: $(openssl rand -base64 24)"
echo "LITELLM_MASTER_KEY: $(openssl rand -base64 24)"
echo "N8N_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN: $(openssl rand -base64 24)"
echo "MCPO_API_KEY: $(openssl rand -base64 24)"
```

**Important**: Save these passwords somewhere safe! You'll need them if you ever need to restore from backup.

### Update Your .env File
1. Open the .env file in a text editor:
```bash
open -e .env
```

2. Replace each password/key with the ones you generated above:
   - Find `POSTGRES_PASSWORD='your_secure_postgres_password_here'`
   - Replace with `POSTGRES_PASSWORD='[your generated password]'`
   - Repeat for all the other passwords and keys

3. Save the file and close the editor

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Run the Setup

### Make Scripts Executable
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### Run the Setup Script
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The setup script will:
- ✅ Check that Docker is working
- ✅ Verify your passwords are set
- ✅ Create all necessary folders
- ✅ Download AI software (this takes 5-10 minutes)
- ✅ Download AI models (this takes 10-20 minutes)

**Be Patient**: The AI model download is large (about 4GB). Go get a coffee! ☕

## 🎬 Step 5: Start Your AI Stack

### Start Everything
```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

You'll see services starting one by one:
1. 🐘 PostgreSQL (database)
2. 🔴 Redis (cache)

4. 🔄 n8n (workflows)
5. 🎯 LiteLLM (AI proxy)
6. 🌐 Open WebUI (chat interface)
7. 🔗 MCP servers (AI protocol)

**Total time**: 2-3 minutes for everything to start

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Docker is not running"
1. Check if Docker Desktop is open (whale icon in menu bar)
2. If not open, start Docker Desktop from Applications
3. Wait for it to fully start before trying again

### "Services won't start" or "Out of memory"
1. Close other applications to free up RAM
2. In Docker Desktop settings, reduce memory allocation
3. Edit your `.env` file to use smaller models:
   ```bash
   OLLAMA_MAX_MODELS=1
   DEFAULT_MODELS=llama3.2:1b
   ```
4. Restart: `./scripts/stop.sh && ./scripts/start.sh`

### "AI models are slow"
- Use **llama3.2:1b** instead of 3b for faster responses
- Close other applications
- Make sure your Mac isn't running on battery power

### "Can't access web interfaces"
1. Make sure services are running: `docker-compose ps`
2. Try restarting your browser
3. Check if something else is using those ports

### "Lost my passwords"
If you lose your `.env` file:
1. Stop everything: `./scripts/stop.sh --volumes` (⚠️ This deletes data!)
2. Regenerate passwords and run setup again
3. Or restore from backup: `./scripts/restore.sh --list`
